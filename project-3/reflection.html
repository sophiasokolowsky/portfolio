        <h2>Take a look at my answers to some reflective questions I was asked in regards to this webpage.</h2>
        <br>
        <h4>Where did the components you observed do well in terms of usability and accessibility? How have you applied this 
            to your design?</h4>
        <p>All of the components I observed made their components noticeable for users both visually looking at the screen and 
            those using a screen reader. These applications had large buttons and boxes, and structured their focus order in a 
            way that highlighted their main components (especially the search bar I was looking at). They also all had some sort 
            of hover feature so that the user could potentially see a change when they hovered over or focused on the search bar. 
            I made sure that all of my buttons are large and easily readable in my design and I also made sure that all of my 
            main components (to include text boxes) are accessible through the screen reader and keyboard. I included hover 
            features as well that are highly distinguishable so it is clear to the user that they are hovering over a clickable 
            element.</p>
        <h4>Are there accessibility considerations that were not addressed that you accounted for in your own design?</h4>
        <p>The webpages that I looked at were all easy to use as a user with 20/20 vision. However, if someone had limited 
            vision, I think it would have been very challenging to be able to notice the change in the color of the hover state 
            or even read some of the buttons themselves. In my design, I made sure to create more distinction in the colors 
            between element states, more contrast with the buttons and their text, and larger text in general.</p>
        <h4>How does the change you have made in your own design solve for a mismatch in our world?</h4>
        <p>A lot of people experience mismatch based on the way they view something and understanding what they are supposed to
             do with it or learn from it. Throughout my entire webpage, I make sure to indicate in writing what someone should 
             be looking for or doing. An example of this is on my homepage where I tell my user to look to the far left of the 
             screen to click on an item in the menu bar. Another example of this is when I tell my user to click the buttons 
             below to learn more. These are also read aloud by the screen reader which benefits those who do not have perfect 
             vision. I think this helps solve a mismatch in communication between the user and the webpage designers expectations 
             for what certain elements are meant to do.</p>
        <h4>Give two examples of how the accessibility/inaccessibility of those inputs or outputs could also impact users 
            with impairments either positively or negatively, respectively.</h4>
        <p>CNN has a really bad design for their focus order which heavily impacts the effectiveness of the screen reader. 
            The screen reader reads information behind the page that is displayed when a user is using the search bar. This 
            negatively impacts users who have bad eyesight or are unable to use a mouse and rely heavily on the screen reader 
            to move around the screen. If they are hearing that they are on a different portion of the screen, they might not 
            ever be able to actually use any of the functionality provided by the webpage.</p>
        <p>Googles entire webpage is designed so that any user can use all aspects of the page using nothing more than a keyboard. 
            For people with disabilities such as Parkinsons disease or Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, who are not able to use the 
            mouse or keypad, this is a very useful form of accessibility for them.</p>
        <h4>Between mouse, keyboard, touch/mobile, and screen reader users, which do you think are most commonly prioritized in the 
            process of creating components? How might this impact the user experience?</h4>
        <p>I think designers most commonly prioritize touch/mobile users. This negatively impacts user experience as 
            most applications are deisgned for touch which has a combination of tap/click and a keyboard. Therefore,
            most applications are not entirely accessible to someone who can use only a mouse or only a keyboard. This
            causes a mismatch between many users and the virtual environments they often interact with.</p>
