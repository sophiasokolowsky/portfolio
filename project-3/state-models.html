        <h2>Let's take a look at state models!</h2>
        <h3>On this page, we will take a look into state models for specific components and their redesign. A state model visually 
            represents the various states of a component from their default to their various outputs based on user input.</h3>
        <h4>Look at the orignial state models of the CAB search button below. The first image shows the available 
            states for a mouse user and the second shows the available states for a keyboard user.</h4>
            <div class="legend">
                <img src="./assets/org-mouse-user.png" alt="original mouse user state model" class="new-buttons">
            </div>
            <div class="legend">
                <img src="./assets/org-keyboard-user.png" alt="original keyboard user state model" class="new-button">
            </div>

        <h4>Now, the following images show improved state availability to enhance user experience: </h4>
            <div class="legend">
                <img src="./assets/new-mouse-user.png" alt="new mouse user state model" class="new-buttons">
            </div>
            <div class="legend">
                <img src="./assets/new-keyboard-user.png" alt="new keyboard user state model" class="new-buttons">
            </div>
        
        <h4>Now that we have seen the state models for CABs search button, let us now take a look at the button itself. Below, you 
            can see the original design for the button in its initial state (lighter) and the original design for the button in 
            its hover state (darker).</h4>
            <div class="legend">
                <img src="./assets/org-cab.png" alt="original CAB search button initial state" class="new-buttons">
            </div>
            <div class="legend">
                <img src="./assets/org-cab-hover.png" alt="original CAB search button hover state" class="new-buttons">
            </div>

        <h4>Notice how the difference between these two states in the original images is very slight. I have redeisgned the button 
            for these two states to make the difference easier for any user to see. Below, the first image shows the CAB button 
            in its improved initial state and the second image shows the CAB button in its improved hover state.</h4>
            <div class="legend">
                <img src="./assets/new-cab-button.png" alt="new CAB search button in initial and hover states" class="new-buttons">
            </div>
