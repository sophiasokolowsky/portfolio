        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>As an officer in the United States Air Force, it is common we must login to the Holm Center portal to do paperwork. Upon loading into
            the Air Force's Holm Center Homepage, it is shocking to see how poorly designed it was. The text is nearly impossible to read, and it is difficult to
            figure out where to login or even which buttons could be pressed! I decided to redesign their webpage as my own personal project.
            I focused on improving the page's responsiveness and user functionality to help improve usability and therefore security. The more intuitive the design, the safer it is for everyday users to access.

      <div id="buttons">
        <button onclick="showText('text1')" class="button-1">Accessibility:</button>
        <p id="text1" class="hidden-box">
          This webpage is only accessible if the user has access to a desktop computer with a mouse. Attempting to navigate through 
          the page using only a keyboard results in only being able to access 2 of the 13 major components. When trying to use the 
          webpage on a mobile device, the text becomes too small to read, components do not stack correctly, the user loses access 
          to two of the components in the navigation bar, and the overall functionality of the webpage falls apart.          
        </p>

        <button onclick="showText('text2')" class="button-1">Efficiency:</button>
        <p id="text2" class="hidden-box">When a user clicks any of the interactive components, they load in the same tab, causing 
          the user to have to either press the back button (which then usually results in improper loading of the webpage's 
          contents) or manually searching for the landing page again. This also negates the usability of the 'home button' in 
          the header, as once a user leaves the homepage, the icon disappears.</p>

        <button onclick="showText('text3')" class="button-1">Learnability:</button>
        <p id="text3" class="hidden-box">Upon accessing this webpage for the first time, it would be very difficult for users to 
          navigate the page without assistance. They would discover that 3 of the interactive components have no purpose (i.e. 
          You click the dropdown menu for there to be one option which is the same as the title of the dropdown menu). They would 
          also discover that a few of the boxes in the main content section are interactive buttons all with different hover 
          features, and the rest are not interactive at all.</p>

      <div id="buttons">
        <button onclick="showText('text4')" class="button-1">General Design Issues:</button>
        <p id="text4" class="hidden-box">The text is written in very fine, very small print which makes it difficult to read. This 
          is very important given the opening message on the site is meant to alert users to information security concerns upon 
          them logging into the site with their credentials. Additionally, the page has no clear hierarchy, making it confusing 
          for users to navigate. Lastly, the color palette is hard on the eyes due to poor contrast and coordination.
        </p>

        <button onclick="showText('text5')" class="button-1">Conceptual Model Misalignment:</button>
        <p id="text5" class="hidden-box">When accessing a United States military webpage, the typical user would assume the 
          webpage to be functional and well designed as the military provides the country's most highly-trained cybersecurity and 
          computer science specialists. Additionally, one would think the military wants to portray themselves as being 
          professional, attentive to detail, and excellent at what they do. This is not reflected in this webpage.</p>

    <h2>How did I go about redesigning this page?</h2>
    <p>Given the usability issues discussed on the conceptualize page, I knew I had to change the text sizes, color palette, and general layout design of the page. Below, you can see an image of the visual design style guide I created before starting to put together my mockups.</p>
    <section class="image-process">
        <img src="./assets/design-palette.png" alt="Image of Palette" class="palette-image">
    </section>
    <p>In order to have a fully accessible and functional site, I decided it would be crucial to have the webpage be fully responsive - 
        meaning it was viewable and usable on all different screen sizes. As this is a complicated task since the layout must change for various
        screen types, I started by creating mockup designs before beginning to code the actual site. Below, you can see my mockup designs
        for each screen size along with annotations describing how the accessibility and usability is improved. To help maintain layout regardless of
        screensizes, I used combinations of flexbox, grid layouts, and CSS's @media function to specify specific redesigns for each screen.
    </p>
    <section class="mockup-box">
        <p class="mockup-title">DESKTOP MOCKUP:</p>
        <p>All redundant and useless buttons were removed from the page increasing user efficiency without hindering 
          usability. All interactive components are designed with learnability in mind by maximizing their intuitive value. Additionally, 
          there is a clear hierarchy among components due to bigger text, improved layout, and contrasting colors.</p>
        <img src="./assets/desktop-mockup.png" alt="Image of Desktop Mockup" class="mockup-1">
        <p class="mockup-title">TABLET MOCKUP:</p>
          <p>When transitioning from a desktop view to a tablet view, everything remains the same, but some text sizes shrink 
            slightly along with the padding in the footer. Everything remains easily readable and digestible for new users.</p>
          <img src="./assets/tablet-mockup.png" alt="Image of Tablet Mockup" class="mockup-2">
          <p class="mockup-title">PHONE MOCKUP:</p>
          <p>As screen size continues to shrink towards the size of a phone screen, components begin to stack. With properly 
            stacked components that are fully responsive to changing screen sizes, all interactive components are and 
            remain accessible for all users. The notice collapses (unless prompted to expand by user interaction) but remains 
            the focus of the page to ensure users do not miss it.</p>
