      <a href="./project-1/project-1.html" class="project-box">
        <h3>Air Force Holm Center Portal Caset Study & Redesign</h3>
        <p>A redesign of the U.S. Air Force Holm Center's homepage focused on improving accessibility, usability, and 
          mobile compatibility. I restructured the site's architecture by improving its visual hierarchy, created mockups for 
          desktop, tablet, and mobile user views, and coded a homepage prototype with fully responsive elements, providing 
          a more intuitive user experience.</p>
      </a>

      <a href="./story-board-project-2/project-2.html" class="project-box">
        <h3>Laundry Interface Case Study & Redesign</h3>
        <p>This project explores how improving everyday system design - in this case, Brown University's dorm laundry interface - 
          can strengthen user trust, security, and operational efficiency. By identifying usability flaws and addressing points of 
          user frustration, I focused on how thoughtful redesigns promote better system compliance and resilience, both of which 
          are foundational to cybersecurity practices in critical environments like the Air Force.</p>

      <a href="./project-3/project-3.html" class="project-box">
        <h3>Case Study on Accessible Design & System Resilience</h3>
        <p>This project analyzes critical components of everyday digital interfaces to identify how input methods, output behavior, 
          and component states affect accessibility, usability, and user trust. By ensuring that systems are intuitive and inclusive 
          across all user interactions, I demonstrated how intentional design can strengthen compliance and therefore security.</p>

      <a href="./project-4/index.html" class="project-box">
        <h3>Secure Learning Platform Design</h3>
        <p>This project focused on designing an intuitive, secure learning platform for Miyagi Labs based solely on a startup 
          concept description. Through iterative prototyping, critique, and user testing, we explored how system clarity, 
          accessibility, and component consistency drive user trust and operational success.</p>
