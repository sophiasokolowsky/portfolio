        <h2>How do various outputs effect user accessibility?</h2>
        <h3>On this page, we will take a look specifically at the outputs of pressing the search button across various 
            applications to determine how they effect the accessibility of the button. We will also see how a webpages focus order
            and screen reader capabilities effect its usability.</h3>
        <h4>I analyzed each of these one by one. Click each button to learn more about my experience!</h4>

        </div>

        <!--Info buttons-->
        <div id="buttons">
            <button onclick="showText('text1')" class="button button-21">Google: Output</button>
            <p id="text1" style="display: none;">When hovering over the button, the outline around it highlights white, 
                letting the user know that they can click it. When clicking down, nothing happens. When releasing the click, 
                the search is submitted. The way the user knows their search has been submitted is because the page is redirected 
                to show their search results. The actual search button does not display any output that would make the user 
                aware that they have clicked it. The outline remains white until the page is redirected. I think this is a simple 
                design that works well because it is clear about what is happening but does not come across as overwhelming.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text2')" class="button button-22">Google: Focus Order</button>
            <p id="text2" style="display: none;">Search bar -> Search by Voice Icon -> Search by Image Icon -> Google Search Button 
                -> Vibe of the Day Button... Cycles 1-5 then back to 1. This focus order makes a lot of intuitive sense as it 
                follows the key elements on the screen in order from top to bottom, left to right. This makes sense for someone 
                who can not read what is on the screen, as it follows the layout of the screen and is very intentional.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text3')" class="button button-23">Google: Screen Reader</button>
            <p id="text3" style="display: none;">Upon activating voiceover, it alerts the user that they are on the Google 
                Homepage. It states that the user is currently on a combo box. Type text or to see a list of options, press 
                control+option+space. This is very helpful as it tells the user how to interact with the component that they 
                are on. However, I think it would be more helpful if it made it more clear that it is a search box. I personally 
                would not know what a combo box meant if I was not able to see it. From there, if the user presses tab, it moves 
                to the next item on the screen, alerts the user to what this item is (a button, a frame, Google, leaving 
                Google, etc.) and tells the user what keys to press to interact with the item/object they are currently on. 
                If you actively put in a search and use the arrow keys to go up and down the list of search suggestions, it 
                reads the text to you. I think that overall Google is well equipped and designed to allow user interaction 
                using voiceover.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text4')" class="button button-24">CNN: Output</button>
            <p id="text4" style="display: none;">When hovering over the search icon, there is no change on the button that 
                notifies the user that they can click it. Upon clicking the button, there is still no change in output. Once 
                releasing the click of the button, the website reloads and outputs a list of related news articles based on 
                the users search. I think this could be improved by having some kind of change in the output of the button 
                when hovering over it to make it clear to the user that they can click it for functionality, rather than 
                it appearing as decoration on the website.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text5')" class="button button-25">CNN: Focus Order</button>
            <p id="text5" style="display: none;">Sign In Button -> Search Bar -> Unclear what the selected object is, but it 
                shows all the various news article topics one can find on the website -> Browser Search Bar... Cycles 1-4 then 
                back to 1. This focus order is a bit ambiguous. Considering a user has already navigated to the search 
                portion of the website, I do find it weird that the website prioritizes the sign in button first. While 
                it may be annoying to the user however, it might make the most sense for CNN since they make a profit off of 
                subscriptions. Once you click to the search bar, the next focus item is not the search icon as one might expect. 
                It actually skips to the bottom of the page to show all the various news topics one can choose from. This is 
                not intuitive and I think there should be a focus step added to include the search icon. Lastly, it has a focus 
                item of the browser's search bar. I think this is unnecessary.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text6')" class="button button-26">CNN: Screen Reader</button>
            <p id="text6" style="display: none;">Upon activating voiceover, it alerts the user that they are on the CNN website. 
                When navigating to the search bar, voice over notifies you that you are in the search bar. It then tells you to 
                type text and tells you how to submit your search. However, when clicking tab, it becomes clear that while the 
                search bar and its search suggestions take up the entirety of the screen, the Screen Reader is actually reading 
                information from the homepage of CNN which is hidden by the search bar. This is incredibly confusing, and 
                difficult to interpret and navigate. It is so overwhelming, no one would be able to understand what is going on 
                if they were not able to see the screen (and it took a combination of voiceover and seeing the screen for me to 
                figure out what it was doing). This is a very bad design.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text7')" class="button button-27">CAB: Output</button>
            <p id="text7" style="display: none;">When hovering over the search icon, the entire button darkens in color. 
                This notifies the user that they can click it. Upon clicking down, no output changes. When the user releases 
                their click, a panel slides out from the right side of the main panel with a list of courses matching the 
                users search. Once the user moves their mouse so it is no longer hovering on the search button, the button 
                returns to its normal color. This is well designed, easy to understand, and very readable. I really like the 
                aspect of the darkening of actionable objects as the user hovers over them as even people who are colorblind 
                would be able to notice a difference.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text8')" class="button button-28">CAB: Focus Order</button>
            <p id="text8" style="display: none;">Main Search Bar -> Term Selection Drop Down -> Course Number Selection Drop 
                Down -> Modes of Instruction Drop Down -> Saved Carts Drop Down -> Department Drop Down -> Subject Drop Down -> 
                Time Drop Down -> Credits Drop Down -> Instructor Search Bar -> Browser Search Bar... Cycles 1-11 then back to 1. 
                This focus order makes a lot of sense as it follows the general layout of the webpages key elements. 
                It has them prioritized from top to bottom. That being said, it does skip the Find Courses Button which 
                submits the users search. I think this should be added as a step in-between the 4th and 5th step.</p>

            <button onclick="showText('text9')" class="button button-29">CAB: Screen Reader</button>
            <p id="text9" style="display: none;">Overall, I deem this voiceover functionality as highly effective. When activating 
                it, it alerts the user that they are on the Courses at Brown webpage. When activating the search bar, it tells 
                the user to type in a keyword or subject, but it does not specify that this is a search box, which would be helpful. 
                It then goes down the left panel of the webpage and highlights each object when pressing tab to include the Find 
                Courses button. It does not skip any which is very good. It also notifies the user on how to use their 
                keyboard to use any of the objects functions. One downside is that it fails to access any other portion of the 
                webpage (only the search fields on the left side). I think it would be useful if it could also access the 
                recommended course listings in the center of the webpage as they are a key element when looking at the screen.</p>

        <h4>As you can see above, I most prefer CABs output functions, and Googles focus order and Screen Reader capabilities. 
            I strongly dislike CNNs Screen Reader capabilities. The Screen Reader always notifies users what key presses they 
            must initiate to make use of the object they have selected, but the focus order of the webpage has a huge impact 
            on the accessibility of the webpage via the Screen Reader.</h4>
