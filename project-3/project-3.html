        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my accessible components project! This project explores how improving everyday user interfaces can increase 
            user accessibility and usability, leading to proper interface usage and website security. I began by analyzing key 
            components across three different, everyday applications, evaluating each in terms of user experience and accessibility 
            performance. From this analysis, I selected one component to focus on and created detailed state models to visualize 
            how it functions across different user interactions. I then iteratively redesigned the component to improve its 
            learnability, memorability, efficiency, and accessibility.</p>

        <h2>Part 1: Focusing on User Inputs</h2>
        <h3>How do user inputs affect accessibility?</h3>
        <p>The first part of my design process was to look into how user interaction and input can change the accessibility features 
            of a given webpage component. I chose to explore the effects of input on a search bar. I chose to interact with three 
            different applications' search bars: 
            <ul>
                <li>CNN</li>
                <li>CAB</li>
                <li>Google</li>
            </ul>
            I focused on using three different user inputs with these search bars by using: 
            <ul>
                <li>only a mouse</li>
                <li>only a keyboard</li>
                <li>only touch</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Please refer to the images below for reference of what each applications search bar looks like:</p>

        <!--Info buttons-->
        <div id="buttons">
            <button onclick="showText('text1')" class="button button-1">Google: Mouse User</button>
            <ul id="text1" style="display: none;">
                    <li>When a user clicks on the search bar, a list of trending searches appear.</li>
                    <li>If a user wishes to input their own prompt, they must use the keyboard to type in their response.</li>
                    <li>If a user begins typing a search, recommended searches appear in a drop down that the user can access via mouse or trackpad.</li>
                    <li><strong>Note: the search bar is only accessible for user search if they have access to a keyboard</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text2')" class="button button-2">Google: Keyboard User</button>
            <ul id="text2" style="display: none;">
                <li>Loading into the google homepage, the search bar is already activated awaiting user input.</li>
                <li>The line that indicates this is blinking in place to let users know that it is awaiting input.</li>
                <li>A user can then use the keyboard to type in their search and then press enter to initiate the search.</li>
                <li>While typing, a user can also use the down/up arrows to select a suggested search based on the text they have input.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: By only accessing the keyboard to use Googles Search Bar, users can fully carry out the task.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text3')" class="button button-3">Google: Touch User</button>
            <ul id="text3" style="display: none;">
                <li>On a mobile device, Googles home page does not have the search bar automatically activated.</li>
                <li>In this case, the user must click an existing recommended search based on world wide trending searches 
                    from a displayed list or they must click into the search bar itself.</li>
                <li>Once they click into the search bar, it is activated and awaiting their input.</li>
                <li>They must then use the touch keyboard to type in their search.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: A user can use all functional aspects of the search bar using touch features such as clicking into the search bar and 
                    using the touch keyboard to type their search.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text4')" class="button button-4">CNN: Mouse User</button>
            <ul id="text4" style="display: none;">
                <li>When a user lands on CNNs search page, there is a displayed search bar that is 
                    not currently selected.</li>
                <li>A user then must use their mouse or trackpad to click into the search bar. From here, 
                    they must use their keyboard to type in a search.</li>
                <li>They can then use their mouse to click on the search icon in 
                    the far right hand side of the search bar to submit their search.</li>
                <li>It is inconvenient to use the mouse to 
                    initiate the search as the user must travel their mouse or trackpad across the entire page to reach the search 
                    icon.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: the search bar is not functionally accessible without a keyboard.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text5')" class="button button-5">CNN: Keyboard User</button>
            <ul id="text5" style="display: none;">
                <li>To activate the search bar so that it is awaiting user input, the user must 
                    hit the tab bar on their keyboard twice, which is not at all intuitive or learnable.</li>
                <li>Once there, the line that 
                    indicates search bar activation is blinking to let users know that it is awaiting 
                    input.</li>
                <li>From there, a user can use the keyboard to type in their search and then press enter to initiate the 
                    search.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: By only accessing the keyboard to use CNNs Search Bar, one can fully complete 
                    the task.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text6')" class="button button-6">CNN: Touch User</button>
            <ul id="text6" style="display: none;">
                <li>On a mobile device, CNNs search bar is not automatically activated.</li>
                <li>Therefore, 
                    a user must first click into the search bar box and then use their touch keyboard to type in their search.</li>
                <li>They 
                    can then choose to either press search/enter on their touch keyboard or they can press the search icon on the 
                    right side of the search bar.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: A user can use all functional aspects of the search bar using touch features such as clicking into the search bar and using the touch 
                    keyboard to type their search.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text7')" class="button button-7">CAB: Mouse User</button>
            <ul id="text7" style="display: none;">
                <li>On the CAB homepage, the search bar is automatically activated.</li>
                <li>A user must then use their keyboard to type in a search prompt.</li>
                <li>From there, if a user wishes to submit their search, they must move their mouse away from the search bar a couple inches to a button that says find courses. This is not intuitive.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: the search bar is not functionally accessible without a keyboard.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text8')" class="button button-8">CAB: Keyboard User</button>
            <ul id="text8" style="display: none;">
                <li>Upon entering the CAB homepage, a user must simply type in their search 
                    prompt on their keyboard, then press enter to submit their search.</li>
                <li>It is very straightforward and intuitive.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: By only accessing the keyboard to use CABs Search Bar, one can fully carry out 
                    the task they are trying to achieve. </strong></li> 
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text9')" class="button button-9">CAB: Touch User</button>
            <ul id="text9" style="display: none;">
                <li>On a mobile device, CABs search bar is automatically activated.</li>
                <li>A user can immediately type their search prompt using the touch keyboard function and then they can either hit 
                    enter on that keyboard, or they must scroll down and click the button that says find courses.</li>
                <li><strong>Note: A user can use all functional aspects of the search bar using touch features such as clicking into the search bar and 
                    using the touch keyboard to type their search.</strong></li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <p>As you can see above, most search bars can not be used without a keyboard, as it is required for the user to type in their 
            prompt. Automatic search bar activation increases accessibility. Although it is intuitive for users to click into the search bar with a mouse, it is far less intuitive,
             learnable, and memorable for them to have to hit the tab bar twice if they only have access to a keyboard. Lastly, having 
             the ability to either press enter or click a search button to initiate a users search, is beneficial. This makes sure a 
             user has multiple accessible ways to submit their search.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Focusing on Output</h2>
        <h3>How do various outputs effect user accessibility?</h3>

        <p>After my analysis of user input interaction, I decided to take a look into the outputs of pressing the search button across the same webpages. I also looked into the focus order and screen reader usability on each page.</p>

        <p><strong>Click on each button to learn more about my experience!</strong></p>
        
        <div class="legend">
            <img src="./assets/legend-2.png" alt="legend 2" class="legend-image-2">
        </div>

        <!--Info buttons-->
        <div id="buttons">
            <button onclick="showText('text11')" class="button button-21">Google: Output</button>
            <ul id="text11" style="display: none;">
                <li>When hovering over the button, the outline around it highlights white, 
                    letting the user know that they can click it.</li>
                <li>When clicking down, nothing happens. When releasing the click, 
                    the search is submitted.</li>
                <li>The way the user knows their search has been submitted is because the page is redirected 
                    to show their search results.</li>
                <li>The actual search button does not display any output that would make the user 
                    aware that they have clicked it.</li>
                <li>The outline remains white until the page is redirected. This is a simple 
                    design that works well because it is clear about what is happening but is not overwhelming.</li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text21')" class="button button-22">Google: Focus Order</button>
            <ul id="text21" style="display: none;">
                <li>Search bar -> Search by Voice Icon -> Search by Image Icon -> Google Search Button 
                    -> Vibe of the Day Button... Cycles 1-5 then back to 1.</li>
                <li>This focus order makes a lot of intuitive sense as it 
                    follows the key elements on the screen in order from top to bottom, left to right.</li>
                <li>This makes sense for someone 
                    who can not read what is on the screen, as it follows the layout of the screen and is very intentional.</li> 
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text31')" class="button button-23">Google: Screen Reader</button>
            <ul id="text31" style="display: none;">
                <li>Upon activating voiceover, it alerts the user that they are on the Google 
                    Homepage.</li>
                <li>It states that the user is currently on a combo box and how to use it. Could be more clear in specifying that it is a search box.</li>
                <li>From there, if the user presses tab, it moves 
                    to the next item on the screen, alerts the user to what this item is (a button, a frame, Google, leaving 
                    Google, etc.) and tells the user what keys to press to interact with the item/object they are currently on.</li>
                <li>If you actively put in a search and use the arrow keys to go up and down the list of search suggestions, it 
                    reads the text to you.</li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text41')" class="button button-24">CNN: Output</button>
            <ul id="text41" style="display: none;">
                <li>When hovering over the search icon, there is no change on the button that 
                    notifies the user that they can click it.</li>
                <li>Upon clicking the button, there is still no change in output.</li>
                <li>Once 
                    releasing the click of the button, the website reloads and outputs a list of related news articles based on 
                    the users search.</li>
                <li>Could be improved by having some kind of change in the output of the button 
                    when hovering over it to make it clear to the user that they can click it for functionality, rather than 
                    it appearing as decoration on the website.</li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text51')" class="button button-25">CNN: Focus Order</button>
            <ul id="text51" style="display: none;">
                <li>Sign In Button -> Search Bar -> Unclear what the selected object is, but it 
                    shows all the various news article topics one can find on the website -> Browser Search Bar... Cycles 1-4 then 
                    back to 1.</li>
                <li>Once you click to the search bar, the next focus item is not the search icon as one might expect. 
                    It actually skips to the bottom of the page to show all the various news topics one can choose from.</li>
                <li>This is 
                    not intuitive and I think there should be a focus step added to include the search icon.</li>
                <li>Lastly, it has a focus 
                    item of the browser's search bar which is unnecessary.</li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text61')" class="button button-26">CNN: Screen Reader</button>
            <ul id="text61" style="display: none;">
                <li>Upon activating voiceover, it alerts the user that they are on the CNN website.</li>
                <li>When navigating to the search bar, voice over notifies you that you are in the search bar.</li>
                <li>It then tells you to 
                    type text and tells you how to submit your search.</li>
                <li>However, when clicking tab, it becomes clear that while the 
                    search bar and its search suggestions take up the entirety of the screen, the Screen Reader is actually reading 
                    information from the homepage of CNN which is hidden by the search bar.</li>
                <li>This is incredibly confusing, and 
                    difficult to interpret and navigate.</li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text71')" class="button button-27">CAB: Output</button>
            <ul id="text71" style="display: none;">
                <li>When hovering over the search icon, the entire button darkens in color.</li>
                <li>This notifies the user that they can click it. Upon clicking down, no output changes.</li>
                <li>When the user releases 
                    their click, a panel slides out from the right side of the main panel with a list of courses matching the 
                    users search.</li>
                <li>Once the user moves their mouse so it is no longer hovering on the search button, the button 
                    returns to its normal color.</li>
                <li>This is well designed, easy to understand, and very readable.</li>
                <li>The darkening of actionable objects as the user hovers over them as even people who are colorblind 
                    would be able to notice a difference.</li> 
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text81')" class="button button-28">CAB: Focus Order</button>
            <ul id="text81" style="display: none;">
                <li>Main Search Bar -> Term Selection Drop Down -> Course Number Selection Drop 
                    Down -> Modes of Instruction Drop Down -> Saved Carts Drop Down -> Department Drop Down -> Subject Drop Down -> 
                    Time Drop Down -> Credits Drop Down -> Instructor Search Bar -> Browser Search Bar... Cycles 1-11 then back to 1.</li>
                <li>This focus order makes a lot of sense as it follows the general layout of the webpages key elements. 
                    It has them prioritized from top to bottom.</li>
                <li>That being said, it does skip the Find Courses Button which 
                    submits the users search, negativley impacting usability.</li>
            </ul>

            <button onclick="showText('text91')" class="button button-29">CAB: Screen Reader</button>
            <ul id="text91" style="display: none;">
                <li>This voiceover functionality is highly effective.</li>
                <li>When activating 
                    it, it alerts the user that they are on the Courses at Brown webpage.</li>
                <li>When activating the search bar, it tells 
                    the user to type in a keyword or subject, but it does not specify that this is a search box, which would be helpful.</li>
                <li>It then goes down the left panel of the webpage and highlights each object when pressing tab to include the Find 
                    Courses button.</li>
                <li>It also notifies the user on how to use their 
                    keyboard to use any of the objects functions.</li>
                <li>One downside is that it fails to access any other portion of the 
                    webpage (only the search fields on the left side).</li>
                <li>It would be useful if it could also access the 
                    recommended course listings in the center of the webpage as they are a key element when looking at the screen.</li>  
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>As you can see above, CABs output functions, and Googles focus order and Screen Reader capabilities are superior. 
            The focus order of a webpage has a huge impact 
            on the accessibility of the Screen Reader and therefore makes the webpage accessible or inaccessible for certain users.</p>

        <h2>Part 3: Component State Models</h2>
        <p>My next step in the deisgn process was understanding the states in which specific components moved through given a user input.
            I created state models to show this.</p>

            <h4>Look at the orignial state models of the CAB search button below. The first image shows the available 
                states for a mouse user and the second shows the available states for a keyboard user.</h4>

            <h4>Now that we have seen the state models for CABs search button, let us now take a look at the button itself. Below, you 
                can see the original design for the button in its initial state (lighter) and the original design for the button in 
                its hover state (darker).</h4>

            <h4>Notice how the difference between these two states in the original images is very slight. I have redeisgned the button 
                for these two states to make the difference easier for any user to see. Below, the first image shows the CAB button 
                in its improved initial state and the second image shows the CAB button in its improved hover state.</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>All of the components I observed made their components noticeable for users both visually looking at the screen and those using a screen reader.</li>
            <li>All had some sort of hover feature so that the user could potentially see a change when they hovered over or focused on the search bar.</li>
            <li>I made sure that all of my buttons are large and easily readable in my design and I also made sure that all of my main components (to include text boxes) are accessible through the screen reader and keyboard.</li>
            <li>I included hover features as well that are highly distinguishable so it is clear to the user that they are hovering over a clickable element.</li>
            <li>Designers most commonly prioritize touch/mobile users, which negatively impacts other user experiences.</li>
            <li>Most applications are not entirely accessible to someone who can use only a mouse or only a keyboard. This causes a mismatch between many users and the virtual environments they often interact with.</li>
